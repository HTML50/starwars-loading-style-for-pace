# What is this?

## Star Wars Lightsaber/Lasersaber loading bar from Google

### a theme for pace.js

it is a star wars theme for [pace.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/PACE/).

I planned to make a lightsaber loading bar for my site. Searched on Google and found it had an easter egg for **Star Wars : The Force Awakens** in 2015. I found some picture of how it looks like. And I didn't find any already-done code for it. So I make this.

# Demo

I put some photo in it, so that you can watch the loading effect with enough time.

- [Obi style](https://html50.github.io/starwars-loading-style-for-pace/obi.html) 
- [Darth Vader style](https://html50.github.io/starwars-loading-style-for-pace/vader.html) 
- [Google original style](https://html50.github.io/starwars-loading-style-for-pace/google.html) 



here is a demo that with no photo, only loading bar.
